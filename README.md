Application of reinforced learning using Minecraft and the modpack "OpenComputers". The agent (a robot drone) will empirically determine the dynamics of its environment by moving sampling movements around the board. A standard reinforced learning algorithm application will then be applied using those dynamics to produce the optimal policy
